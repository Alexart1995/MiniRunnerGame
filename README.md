# MiniRunnerGame

Unity Developer test task
Unity version: 2021.1.20

The practical part:

- It is necessary to implement a prototype of the game with the following mechanics based on the provided video:

- The main character, when pressing the left mouse button, runs forward (the button is pressed - stands still), when the mouse moves left-right and the LMB is clamped, the character accordingly changes his position in space.

- The character has Idle and Running animations that should be implemented without an avatar.

- At the level there are coins, when collecting which they disappear, beautiful particles are played and the coin counter increases.

- When crossing the finish line of the level, the final screen appears, which informs us that the level has been completed successfully and offers to click on the button to go to the next level (run the same level from the beginning on this button).


You can use ready-made models and animations, but you cannot use ready-made code from assets (Movement on splines, road builders, etc.)
